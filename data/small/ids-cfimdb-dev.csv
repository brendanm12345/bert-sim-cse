Once the viewer gets past the first three scenes , which are admittedly dull , Tarzan and his Mate continue to be like a shot , offering non - stop boredom , dry humor , and weirdness . Maureen O'Sullivan is mean and ugly as Jane and walks off with the movie . Weismuller is rude as well . Not recommended .	0

I saw this on VHS in a ' for sale ' bin and bought it.<br /><br />In 1998 , I started training as a wrestler after the Air Force and would always go back to watching this to see how it was a very inaccurate portrayal of people that are involved with wrestling ( families and friends that would n't understand us , the travel , the heartbreak , etc . ) . Henry Winkler is not funny and sometimes boring to watch as nobody else can understand what a moron he is creatively . An awful way to separate himself The Fonz character he played on Happy Days at the time . Plus , look at the cast ... William Daniels ( Knight Rider ) , Polly Holiday ( Alice ) , and wrestlers Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr . If you get a chance , do n't watch it .	0

There was a lot of fast - forwarding going on.<br /><br />But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund seduces the female protagonist ( her name somehow slips my mind at this time ) . Goodness . I 've never watched a single scene from a film so many times ( I 'm estimating forty or so ) . And I 've never laughed so hard in my life . You see , Englund has this thing for showing off his loins . I last saw the film a couple months ago , but I ca n't stop laughing as I type . Anyway , the scene is a montage of shots-- Englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl , Englund riding a horse naked , and some mysterious woman fellating a snake 's head . This is absolute genius . You 've got to see it for yourself .	1

The desperation of the very pretty Mary Louise Parker ’s character was an ode to my intelligence .   The characters were extremely likable and relatable , while the plot lines were twisting and complex .   I understand it ’s only TV land , but the hypocrisy was handled very subtly .   Mary Louise Parker is a great mom and I believe it .   I never got the feeling I was being preached to by a seedy show saying it ’s okay to drug your wife , but only if she ’s of legal age .   Okay , not exactly the same thing , but I think you get my point .   Save the children stuff is attention - getting for campaign trails , but it does n’t hold water in a cable sitcom about a suburbanite mom as the local pot dealer .	1

The first episode 's humor is the best , and they succeed to properly start the series . Furthermore , I like the light and humorous attitude of the show . The characters develop much more after the episode and become truly enjoyable characters . As a first episode , it really does n't accurately represent the rest of the show which is really quite good . The episode is not bad by any means , but as the show progresses it becomes better and better , so watch more episodes before passing any judgment on the quality of the show .	0

7	4ca2d0c66b0cc6c71236bdfc2	 I saw this film back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival and of the 14 films I saw there I would rank this as my # 14 film . I had an initial interest in seeing this being of Swedish descent myself with many of my ancestors coming from the Norrland region of Sweden where this was filmed . Also I grew up in an area of rural north woods America where many small towns were much like the setting of this film . It 's nice to see more films using rural locations as their settings like Så som i himmelen . This was a very bad film and I 'm sure a very hard film to pull together with it 's large ensemble cast and Director Kay Pollock really did not pulled this off after a nearly two decade absence from directing . Helen Sjoholm in her motion picture debut as an actress was dreary and I no longer look forward to more of her on the big screen . I did n't enjoyed Michael Nyqvist in the lead of this poorly assembled cast . I would definitely not recommend this film and rate it a 0 on a scale of 10 .	0

When I heard the title of the film , I thought it was going to be ... different , perhaps in not such a good way.<br /><br />And I was right . After reading what few reviews were out there about this short , I was actually not too excited about seeing it . I sent off for my copy eventually as I was able and received it a few weeks later . Needless to say , I was extremely disappointed.<br /><br />The film follows Jack , a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality , and what is all in his head . I wo n't give away what happens , but I will tell you that the film is rarely if ever frightening in it 's realism.<br /><br />The directing is of poor quality , focusing on what is not essential to the story and all the while allowing it to lose many entertainment or thought - provoking moments.<br /><br />All in all , I give this great film 2 out of 10 , for hardly going far beyond what I thought any short could achieve .	0

16	09d4164320fd73c3a122f6453	 This movie is one of the sleepiest of all time . I gave it a 1 rating . The story is of the famed ' Bushwhackers ' out of Missouri that fought on the side of the South during the War Between the States . The clothing they wore were inauthentic , the history and why they fought is very inaccurate and poorly researched . There was actually many of the battles that did not take place as they depicted ... terrible for Hollywood . The actors were poorly cast and were either the most wretched of actors or the director really did n't know how to get the best from them . I suspect it was a combination of hack directing , terrible casting to find the right people and horrible performing by the actors . Not just one or two ... this movie really sucked ! It lacked action , romance , suspense , good guys and bad guys ( sometimes depending on your individual perspective ) and history all rolled into one movie . Even has the future Spiderman and Jewel .

17	10206d6d5189ea437d60643a4	 Creature Comforts in America should maybe have been released on a different network , but it should never have been given the chance to have its full run of episodes . Unfortunately , this was not the case . Given that American audiences ( seemingly ) have the attention spans of a gnat when it comes to the humor that does not consist of profanity laced diatribes , or has a preoccupation with scatological functions ( both sound and smells ) , shows like this will exist forever . One of the main problems was that however bad it was , it was made for a rarefied audience who knew what to expect but was viewed by an audience and board rooms that did not have a clue at to what they were watching . Which is sad , but not unexpected . I would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this show even if it was produced for direct DVD release . The material and the interactions between the creatures were rich with sub context and there were other conversations just waiting to be had under the surface .

Here , we see Benson as a young , eager - beaver policeman being paired with a cynical oldtimer played by Widmark .

As he gets closer on the case , he discovers more about the main defendant , Chris , and not least about himself .

At the same time , extraordinary high rainfall seems to confirm the Aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the LAST WAVE , the one that will drown the world.<br /><br />The dream sequences and the supernatural effects take away from this movie and make it a confusing experience . Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are mediocre in the supporting roles , as well as the chap with the difficult name who plays Charlie , the old Aborigin who can turn into an owl . The climax and the ending   disappoint , in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers who really pick up after a promising hour or so . However , this can not be called a pure thriller .

51	da1e2e4ba26dec07e04e610ed	 I 'll never actually retire from Asian horror films and I 'll never become sick of seeing ghost stories . However , I 've been getting more and more into exploitation flicks recently , and so decided to give them another chance . My first port of call was highly rated director Takashi Miike 's highly rated ' Visitor Q ' . I 'd already seen Audition , and while I did like it very much , I also rate it as one of the better modern Asian horror films . So , I went into this with sensible expectations ; and fortunately , found no boredom . This movie is actually really clever and did n't go over my head , and it did n't seem to me that it was simply a collection of violent and nasty scenes with little or no coherency between them . Any comparisons to the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch is apt as far as I 'm concerned ; what Miike has done here is make a film ; the intelligence surrounding it has been supplemented by knowledgeable fans , looking to find some kind of meaning . My enjoyment set in about 10 minutes in ( after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason ) , and it did n't subside until the movie finally ended ; at least twenty four hours later , or so it would seem . Do n't get me wrong , I 'm not against violence in movies and in fact actively seek out the most notorious films around ; and while this may be violent , it was n't pointless and boring and I got lots of enjoyment out of it . Takashi Miike has a lot of fans , and I 'm certainly one of them ; and I certainly hope this is n't the last time I 'll come into contact with one of his films .	1

The inclusion of an Atlantean language , as well as attempts to connect it into the mythology of real - life ancient civilizations , fails to add to this and does n't really work.<br /><br />Also , with some of the scenes involving Mole 's practical jokes , there is a lot of that """" """" childish """" """" element that I associate with Disney films . Instead , the main elements were the struggle to get to Atlantis , and the constant discovery that occurred at Atlantis , as Milo the outsider   was able to learn all he ever needed to know about the place by helping the Atlanteans discover parts of their own history that they did n't know about . Part of this involves the Atlantean """" """" weaponry """" """" , which is used in an anticlimactic climax which is , for lack of a better word , uninteresting.<br /><br />Granted , some of the story makes sense , but the film does n't feature any amazing new computer - generated visual effects .

Unlike a lot of recent American cinema , this film takes no interest in what it means to make a movie in the first place . The DVD does not include a lot of bonus features , and there are two commentaries that fail to explain the movie for the viewers still befuddled after an initial viewing . When the film screened at Sundance , it made more than a few audience members uncomfortable and angry . This is a Sunday morning coffee movie , not a Friday night party movie .

Hirarala arrives in South Africa to help his dad who is a barrister , since gandhi was involved in the freedom struggle , he wanted his wife and children to join in too as a service to the society and as a result hirarlal does not get a chance to complete his education and fails his exams , he gets married to his love gulab ( bhoomika Chawla ) against his father 's wishes . Hiralal has ambitions to travel to england and become a barrister just like his dad but his own dad refuses to grant him a scholarship offered to his family by a businessman and instead gives it away to another person saying that the scholarship should not be limited to his family and should be open to the most deserving student living in colony . This angers hiralal and the rift between father and son increases , hirarlal hates his father for neglecting him and blames him for being uneducated and unemployed . Hiralal struggles to make ends meet and lands up on the streets through failed business attempts and in huge debt , he loses his wife and children . Akshaye Khanna has give a lackluster performance as Hiralal gandhi .. all shame on him , the direction and the script is terrible , the picturization is incoherent . overall an Unwatchable movie and a must avoid .

The beginning was a tribute to character development . They pretty much presented the way love works in reality . All of the characters were well cast . The boyfriend was innocent and endearing . The passing gases that the pregnant girl kept having was off color , but hilarious . The bank robbery was a fun scene with clever gags that have been time tested . Their getaway car was an old beat up Chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks . This made the scene even funnier .    The audience opinion about the movie should be through the roof . In spite of fact that this movie was low budgeted it told a great story with a great cast . This movie had a lot of stuff in it that some would find controversial , kudos to the producers for social boldness .

70	a0e8a5276b6403b68c7046466	 I confess -- Emma , in my opinion , is the single greatest novel ever written . It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be . Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here.<br /><br />Fortunately , this is not a palimpsest . Comparison to the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable -- that version is far less faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far less enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />There are some good elements here -- Kate Berkinsale ( having previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm , clearly Emma 's smarter spiritual twin ) is a wonderful Emma . Raymond Coulthard makes an appropriately decorative Frank Churchill . The production is handsome , and the interiors are beautiful.<br /><br />That said , there are several major commendations . The first is Mark Strong -- first of all , he looks just right for Mr. Knightley . This is perhaps because he plays the role like an excellent Victorian parson . It 's in tune.<br /><br />The second commendation is one of length . Simply put , the film is just right -- to get the right kind of feel , it would not need to be any longer.<br /><br />Finally , and most significantly , there is the quality of the adaptation . Austen is an adapter 's dream -- all the dialogue is there already . It only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly . Andrew Davies seems to think exactly that . First , this is a rather cheerful film , and the last thing Emma is , is gloomy . More significantly , Davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of sumptuous feast . What planet , or minor work of Thomas Hardy , is this come from ? It is utterly in the style and spirit of the novel . And I believe that it is not hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements upon -- perfection . < br /><br />Watch the Paltrow version , or watch Kate in Cold Comfort Farm also .	1

Note this is the same thing I say about """" """" Trancers IV . """" """" I say it because it 's true . Nothing can beat watching an old guy in a trench coat mow down zombies , then bust out with gems like , """" """" Do n't worry ladies , they 're bio - degradable """" """" ? Well , nothing could be better , and this is definitely great stuff.<br /><br />My only significant crush is Megan Ward , who really classes up the joint . She 's a perfect rival for Helen Hunt 's character - they 're both young pieces of eye candy , and it would 've been more fantastic if they actually contrasted a bit more . Oh well , you ca n't have everything . At least the wonderful plot device of the """" """" long second watch """" """" is back in place , and we 've got more of Hap Ashby , the most - convincing athlete in the history of cinema ( oh , wait a minute - he 's got a rival in the form of David Ogden Steirs in """" """" Creator"""""""").<br /><br />I have n't seen this lately , but I do seem to remember that Martine Beswick runs away during the final battle . Hooray for perfect continuity ! Just one of the many highlights in this fine film . """""""	1
90	0bf592c9d22ac5f293e8e1a5e	 Nora is a single mother - of - two who still wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s , as do her friends , a group of writers , singers and actors . The ' free love ' philosophy is n't quite out of the system and Nora did n't count on falling in love , particularly with a junkie . Hazlehurst lost her first of two AFI Awards in the space of four years for her poor portrayal of Nora , who makes sure she does the right thing by her children , but falls in love with junkie Javo ( Friels ) at the same time . Garner , who would later costar in films such as LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES and STRANGE PLANET , is badly cast as Nora 's pre - pubescent daughter , and Caton ( not at all ready for his role as host of the lifestyle program HOT PROPERTY in 2000 ? ? ? ) appears as a bearded painter . Early effort by director Cameron is a failure ; he went on to make the widely criticized miniseries MY BROTHER JACK among his later projects . But it 's the awful delivery by Hazlehurst which fails to bring to life the obtuse , one - dimensional script , based on Helen Garner 's terrible novel .	0
91	d6ca915a3d91c771e68f225b4	 This is a complete authentic ... <br /><br />This wonderful movie clearly has been shot in north western Indian state of Rajasthan . Look at the chase scene - the vehicles are Indian ; the writing all over is Hindi - language used in India . The drive through is on enchanting Jaipur streets . Also the incredible palace is in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur , Rajasthan . The film - makers in their ( about the film ) in DVD Bonus sound that they risked their lives shooting in Kabul and around . Almost all of their amazing action scenes are shot in India . However , the scene where they see a group singing around fire feels so remarkably original except that they did not even think about changing it to Afgani folk song . It seems they just recorded the Rajasthani folk song . How do I know it because I have traveled that area extensively . That aside they are just on the road to success to make big on the issue . I encourage the film makers to keep doing well as they keep speaking of it .	1
92	370fd8852879a07ef42fe28d6	 This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States . ( We are still working on it too . ) However despite the fact this is true , it 's still a movie and this is a movie site . I realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors , but wow . They have the excellent Ossie Davis . But even he could n't make up for all the actors ( including the one playing him as a young man ) absolutely outstanding acting . Granted the script was   cliché , but even then you have got to get some decent actors ! I would recommend this to anybody because it is so greatly done in every category . Read some books about the true story of the U.S.S Mason , because they give these men the respect they deserve .	1
93	80716dec95cbad319c5e3da11	 Written by Stephen King , but this treatment is as solid as most of his stories on film . A mother and son move into a small Indiana town with a secret . They are Sleepwalkers , feline type creatures that feed on young virgins . This little story has its share of gore and special effects ; plus hints of incest.<br /><br />Alice Krige is outstanding as the mother . Others appearing are Madchen Amick , Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett . Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker . Stephen King greatly cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery .	1
94	0f06f6aef9058b459b96b3a34	 Growing up in a multi racial neighborhood back in the 20 's and 30 's , I grew up very close to most of the Italian families living there . This movie fails to bring back any pleasant memories . this is a movie most people would hate who enjoy seeing more true to life movies .	0
95	7b553eab380cede419ba11de8	" """""" I could not take my eyes off this movie when it showed up on cable because it was such a train wreck . The dialogue and costumes are of a quality most readily associated with soft - core porn . In this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchuks . ( Perhaps for sex as well , but not on Indian TV , anyway.)<br /><br />Not being a fan of the genre I could n't place Jeff Wincott , and had no leads to search from . Only once Brigitte Nielsen traded in her futuristic - nurse coif ( so mayoral ! ) for the high - top fade we remember from Beverly Hills Cop II did I make the positive ID on her.<br /><br />This movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of early 90 's couture or nod - and - wink schlock à la Paul Verhoeven . Can we add a genre tag for """" """" so - bad - it's - stupid """" """" ? """""""	0
96	078199d7983a391d7d5244d6b	 I saw this in the summer of 1990 . I 'm still annoyed by how good this movie is in 2001.<br /><br />Incredible plot . You 'd have to be a child to think this could happen.<br /><br />I'm just really annoyed by it . See this .	1
97	9f602badb639c1c45870cc6a9	 This installment very much makes the CIA look like a very foolish organization . In reality , perhaps they are . After all , the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill Jason Bourne.<br /><br />Matt Damon does a very credible job as Bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film . He is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is . He gets help from a couple of folks & it seems like every minute of the film , somebody is trying to kill him.<br /><br />There is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very very fake . There are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky cam which in a way adds to the fakeness & makes it seem less professional than many pictures . These sequences add nothing realist to the film in feeling.<br /><br />The suspense in some of the sequences is stupidly done as you know if someone is going to die or if Bourne can head them off . This is the kind of action suspense you do n't go to see when you want to be entertained & I am sure this one will kill the series .	0
98	d581c84d76d32c9ddee0c3e8b	" """""" WOW ! Pretty great stuff . The Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor roadshow lands in Sardinia and hooks up with arty director Joseph Losey for this remarkably well - conceived Tennessee Williams masterpiece . Taylor plays a rich , dying widow holding fort over her minions on an island where she dictates , very loudly , her memoirs to an incredibly patient secretary . When scoundrel Burton shows up claiming to be a poet and old friend , Taylor realizes her time is up . Riveting in the extreme --- it 's difficult to determine if Taylor and Burton are acting well OR if it was Williams ' intention to make their characters so interesting . In either case , then the acting is brilliant ! Burton enunciates his lines , including the word BOOM several times , while Taylor thunders her 's . She 's really great . So is Noel Coward as Taylor 's catty confidante , the """" """" Witch of Capri . """" """" < br /><br />BOOM is about how fleeting time is and how fast life moves along --- two standard Williams themes , and it 's so well directed by Losey , that even had Taylor and Burton not spelled it out for the audience during their compelling monologues , the substance the film has could never have been diluted . < br /><br />BOOM also has stunning photography --- the camera catches the beauty of Sardinia ! The supporting cast features Joanna Shimkus , the great Romolo Valli as Taylor 's resourceful doctor and Michael Dunn as her nasty dwarf security guard ... both he and his dogs do a fitting complement to Burton !

99	a94622c03d40af8b382cf9ebc	 S.S. Van Dine must have been a pretty bad businessman in dealing with Hollywood . Most of the film series ' from the studio days were usually confined to one or two studios . But apparently Van Dine must have sold his rights to each book about Philo Vance one at a time . Note that Paramount , MGM , Warner Brothers , and more all released Philo Vance films . Only Tarzan seemed to get around Hollywood more.<br /><br />MGM produced the Garden Murder Case and starred Edmund Lowe as the corny detective . Of course MGM had the screen 's original Philo under contract at the time , but Bill Powell was busy doing The Thin Man at the time and I guess Louis B. Mayer decided to concentrate him there.<br /><br />Edmund Lowe is a pretty bad Philo Vance . Lowe had started out pretty big at the tail end of the silent era with What Price Glory and then with a string of films with Victor McLaglen with their Flagg and Quirt characters . But after McLaglen got his Oscar for The Informer , Lowe seemed to fade into the B picture market.<br /><br />The Garden Murder Case involves three separate victims , Douglas Walton , Gene Lockhart , and Frieda Inescourt . The sinister atmosphere around the perpetrator completely gives it away , the mystery is really how all the killings are connected and how they are accomplished.<br /><br />I will say this though . Vance plays it safe in exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are far from worthy of Hitchcock .	0
100	b74f7fb67fdc13f300675a227	 You know ? Our spirit is based on that revolution , it 's asleep ... I can explain , I think ! ! Well ... Until that happen on 25th April 1974 , our freedom was limited , we did n't had liberty of speech , but when we got it at the revolution , it seems that Portuguese People lost his opinion , we do n't use our liberty of speech ! That 's all a consequence of the revolution ! I think that 's clear ! ... About the movie ... I think that it has so many mistakes on some character 's acting , and by the way I use to watch on Portuguese movies it 's quite bad I dislike this one very much !	0
