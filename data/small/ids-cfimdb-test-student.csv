2	1.0	833f75285ae7b156ae7fdca4d	 I did not enjoy this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman , Nina Foch,(Julia Ross ) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work . Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position . Julia obtains the position and is hired by a Mrs. Hughes , ( Dame May Witty ) who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and , conveniently , Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job . George Macready , ( Ralph Hughes ) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives . Unfortunately , this was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery . This stereotypical strange family all live in a huge mansion off the Cornwall Coast of England and there are the prerequisite secret doors and absolutely no suspense .

Okay , the Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends . The premise is that they are trying to get on Broadway in a musical show in where else but New York City . You will see cameos by the then New York City Mayor Ed Koch . Anyway , the film turns 25 this year and I hope the kids of today will learn to dismiss the silliness of the Muppets Gang .

Hundstage was a truly delightful experience . Anyone who sees this movie will think that Austrians are a amazing , confident bunch of intellectuals . It shows a world where love and humanity always exist , a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason - to distract from their own miserable existence . By choosing a documentary - like style with non - professional actors ( most of them look like straight from the imagination of Austrian shock - cartoonist Deix ) director Seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in Austrian ( European ? Western ? ) suburbs . The viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies , violence against women and handicapped people , madness and degradation . But this is n't social criticism . This is just pure shock without any aesthetic value . Instead you get great acting , great cinematography , great filmmaking . If anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes . This is pseudo - social criticism with an amazing sledge hammer . And it looks up to people in an impressive way . It shows ugly people - that is not the reason why I like it .

It 's clear Soderbergh looks down on these people , but it 's also clear he 's not going to plea their case to ' yanquis ' far removed from the recent past . Some of the more important historical aspects contradict what I 've read . To my knowledge Castro did not court the Soviet Union until all attempts to gain acceptance from the United States were exhausted . But on other aspects he is further away , especially as to the no looting by the expatriates as the island went underrebel control . The country 's treasury was left empty .

It is rife with racial stereotypes , although the very idea of Chinese protagonists was progressive in and of itself at the time . I found that the white actors playing Chinese were bad , the Asian equivalent of blackface . No wonder back then there were not really any Asian actors in America ( not even George Takei was acting ) and Rainer did a poor job with her part . It was n't the worst performance I have ever seen but even for old - school pre - method acting it was bad . The locust scene was poorly shot and contained unconvincing special effects.<br /><br />I wonder that the timing of the release during the Great Depression sort of turns this film into an allegory .

35	34.0	62dbd7e79bb86272f94e4cdac	 What can I say about Cruel intentions 2 ? Well , I can say in all honesty , I will certainly watch this film again , without being fastened to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork - orange - style.<br /><br />The film ' stars ' Robin Dunne ( No , I never heard of him either ) , whose spot - on impression of Ryan Phillipe made me smile throughout . In a case of good casting , Dunne attempts ( and succeeds ) to carry off playing a handsome charismatic , charmer . Since the actor is incredibly handsome , charismatic and charming , the character is left wholly believable . Amy Adams , ( she was in an episode of buffy one time ) , tries to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar left off and bring scheming Katherine to life ... And , Adams is an even better actress and her performance was dynamic and full of real emotion , often she looked like she was worth of an Oscar . There were two other good actors in the film however , Barry Flatman ( Saw 2 & Saw 3 ) and Mimi Rogers ( Mrs Kensington in Austion Powers ) , made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of Sebastian and Katherine and are the reason why I rated the film as a 10 , not a 9.<br /><br />The film itself is a good version of the original , with such highs as carbon copy 's of dialogue and mimicked scenes which saluted the originality of the previous film.<br /><br />I think that as a TV show , it might have worked , but if it was recasted with the same cast in the main parts .
36	35.0	815cfdd52da398fec8ec7e57c	 As a disclaimer , I 've seen the movie 5 - 6 times in the last 15 years , and I only just saw the musical this week . This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or was n't in the musical ( however , it tainted me when I watched the musical :)) < br /><br />I ca n't believe Michael Douglas was in that role , along with Kasey . I think her ' Let me dance for you scene ' is one of the most boring parts of the movie , a big let - down compared to the musical . The dancers and singing in the movie are far inferior to the musical , as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger ( and worse in the movie of course ) . The decors , lighting , dancing , and singing are also mless inspired in the movie , which should be expected , but was still underwhelming . < br /><br />The songs that were in common with the musical are worse in the movie , the new ones are not up to par , and the whole movie just does n't deliver compared to the musical in my opinion , especially compared to a musical which has tasteful decors . The worst point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking , and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters , and their dancing is clumsy , and the end product was a disservice to the musical
37	36.0	d8caa5ad6b507e438097f32d6	 Interesting ? Definitely . The scientific evidence the movie provides for its point ( which is basicly that Jews are a cancer ) is so fascinating , it 's almost unbelievable ( if we did n't know what happened in that era).<br /><br />Important ? Yes . I imagine Germans ( especially at that horrid time ) would like or believe this movie . Compare it to Riefenstahl 's Triumf des Willens . Now that was I movie I was impressed with . This is just like that.<br /><br />'Best ' part is a scene from M ( one of my all - time favorites ) where ( the jew , as the announcer so eloquently keeps reminding us ) Lorre plays a child - molester and murderer . In the eyes of these film - makers , only a depraved mind can do so . Uh - huh . Did n't know M was Hitler 's favorite movie , right?<br /><br />No , it 's just plain incredible . Even despite it 's nazi - propaganda genre . 10/10 .

This movie is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen .It has so many redeemable qualities .I just sat through this movie and it was a breeze . It failed to get even a single frown on my face . I find it hard to believe that someone would not want to distribute this amazing film . I felt that this movie was a great attempt at distasteful humor . The best thing about this movie was the soundtrack , I 'm pretty sure that s the reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place . I will wrap this up as I am going to try , I will leave you with this advice . WATCH THIS FILM , IT ROCKS .

The movies production values are pretty high and the story for the most part is nothing but routine , there 's even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring . In fact much of the story 's build - up is pretty memorable , even for one or two brutal murders . But the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax ( in an atmospheric setting ) and one fairly bold , unconventional conclusion.<br /><br />The cast is brilliant for the most part . Stephen Sachs is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in character . Also look for a young Daphne Zuniga as an ill - fated student.<br /><br />Over all this is a pretty outstanding A+ slasher effort , and the finale is well worth savoring and for this viewer made the movie a complete success.<br /><br / > * * out of * * * *

Recently , we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost ! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want . The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO . Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me . The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not . Therefore , it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us ! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics . We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us . Well enough about that.<br /><br />Now this movie is actually very bad . not just bad but very bad . For a change , the critics are spot on . Partly because there is nudity and language they hated it . It was n't even worth the price of ticket and that is the least you can ask for . Is that not right ? Not every movie can not be an academy award nominee . Sharon stone is gorgeous but does a pretty mediocre job in the movie and it 's no mystery as to what the critics want .

48	47.0	64ac8db00ed5dfddb199ef5fc	 Bill Maher 's Religulous is not an attack on organized religion . It 's not an attack on Christianity or Islam . Apart from ridiculing a bunch of Rabbis inventing warped machines to get around Sabbath regulations , he really does n't attack Judaism and seems enraged when a Rabbi actually challenges the existence of the State of Israel . Bill Maher follows his hypothesis to its logical conclusion , and realizes that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian Territories is based on the so called ' holy books ' of organized religion . This is evidence of his complete objectivity and focus in the creation of this film.<br /><br />I find it really easy to believe that the man is atheist and intelligent . Anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs but he offers them more in return . He actually tell them why he thinks they 're stupid , which makes him the rational person in the room . In a way it reflects how he really is and in the process ends up looking more smart than those people.<br /><br />If you want to watch another good movie / documentary about the actual evils of religion and how religion can actually be detrimental to the human civilization , watch Richard Dawkins ' ' Root of All Evil ? ' . It is a brilliantly researched documentary , clearly outlining what it hopes to achieve and how.<br /><br />Bill Maher 's Religulous is funny , poses interesting questions , and provides many insights on so controversial a topic . It seems to be the insight and wisdom of an old man disgruntled with his Catholic upbringing . I almost feel jealous of him .
49	48.0	ebc91cb46a5b850df1af1a05c	 Everybody 's got bills to pay , and that includes Christopher Walken.<br /><br />In Vietnam , a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of POWs , including Christopher Walken . Following a Mad Max 3 ( ! ) Thunderdome fight , and a short massacre later . Walken and some Colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other.<br /><br />Cut to the present ( 1991 ) , and Colombian guy is leading a revolution against El Presidente . He 's successful at first , but after El Presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank , he 's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television . This is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on American telly , which leads Walken to assemble the old squad ( even though he was n't actually part of that squad to begin with ) , in order to invade Colombia and gun down thousands of people.<br /><br />McBain is a monumentally stupid film , but for all that it 's also a good laugh because of the stupidity and its packed with nonsensical action . This is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could Walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression , or even breaking a window ? Also , it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in New York without the police bothering.<br /><br />There 's plenty of d - movie madness to chew on here , from Michael Ironside 's diabolical acting in the Vietnam sequence , to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes , to the side splitting confrontation between Walken and El Presidente , and let 's not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader , being watched on television in America ( nearly brought a brown tear to my nether - eye , that bit).<br /><br />It 's out there for a quid . Do n't buy it unless you have a sense of humour . See how many times you can spot the camera crew too . Terrible Movie .

51	50.0	12ac1be3e8916e3fd6be25f6c	 The emotional impact of this movie defies words . It is rough , obnoxious , ugly , and upsetting all rolled into two hours . This is Will Smith as he ignores his acting ability , the full range of it . Who knew ? I saw The Pursuit of Happiness and thought , this must be a fluke for the blockbuster , over - the - top actor , Smith . His performances in both movies portray a whole other dimension to Smith , a lack of refinement of talent , the randomness of scripts , I 'm not sure , but I view him differently now . Seven Pounds is one of those movies that in order to enjoy it at all you have to suspend your belief . Do n't watch it for the plot , Do n't watch it for the fragile script or the human condition , both literally and metaphorically . It is a story of human garbage , dishonesty , hate , and greed .

There are no scenes that make you jump , and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past , I found boring . There are no genuinely creepy moments in the film and I hate the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets , curtains and the house itself . Jerry Goldsmith 's score did n't give it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you . What I wish could 've happened is for something a little more intense . Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with and I think that he held back a little too much . Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago , and it still holds up .

56	55.0	89fd688920b21f1412e2a9cfe	 It is hard to describe Bug in words , it is one of those films that truly has to be seen to be understood . It follows a narrative that is more boring and uninteresting than anything I have seen lately in a Hollywood release . As its characters react to the chain of events in different ways , and as the events dictate different paths for the characters to follow , the audience is merely an observer . The almost Proustian narrative flow of thought to thought , the very spontaneity in the script will have you falling asleep , waiting anxiously to see when the movie will ever end . And as far as the thematic elements ... there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy , to bright , and then to tragic , all within the span of about a minute . It simply does'nt work.<br /><br />This movie is pure snoozefest . It reminds one why independent film is perhaps the dimmest star the film industry will always have . Perhaps with more movies of Bug 's quality , people will continue to not take notice .
57	56.0	21df0ff4b3c37e46eff927201	 Watch Mission : Galactica and watch the original Living Legend episodes . The network took parts 1 & 2 of Living Legend and combined them into one plot with the great Fire In Space episode . Although Galactica suffered from network - controlled writing and a lack of time to prepare for a proper production , Living Legend is the best of the 1978 TV series . Fire in Space , on its own , is one of the best episodes . As a historical note , watch Galactica , the original Star Trek , and then the revival Trek series , and you 'll see the difference in quality between network - produced sci - fi and syndicated sci - fi .

A secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder , and takes on many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth . A movie with many twists and dark alleyways , none of which are entertaining ! The jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer , is one of the dumbest scenes in Hollywood history , being at very low budget and made during WWII in black and white . Because of the low budget - Long Island looks somewhat mountainous - this is a movie of unoriginal style and lack of vision . Ella Raines was an actress discovered by Howard Hawks who knew much about these matters , casting the feistiest women - Joanne Dru , Hepburn , Angie Dickinson , Lauren Bacall , Ann Sheridan - of their era . Robert Siodmak was of one of several German , Hungarian & Czech film - makers - Sirk , Wilder , Zinnemann , Lubitsch , Curtiz , Lang , etc - who émigrés relocated to Hollywood , but failed to bring vision with them .

Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins . It is definitely worth passing , and lacks the cohesive quality of the Fred & Ginger movies .   The story would probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book , where the humor comes across better . Some of the acting is downright painful to watch ( notably the young boy and the damsel ) .   But ... ! The funhouse dance is worth less than most movies . I never knew that Gracie Allen could dance , but boy does she not in this movie . Have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse ? Imagine tapdancing on one in high heels ! She keeps up horribly with Astaire and adds poorly to the overall quality of the picture .   Several terrible songs , particularly bland are Nice Work if you Can Get It and Stiff Upper Lip .   Recommend to pass for fans of Astaire , Burns & Allen . I had to go back and re - watch the funhouse dance as soon as the credits rolled to see how bad it was again .

' nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as Spock would say , fascinating . The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane . It 's too bad the episode can not live up to this incredible premise . Obviously , I think , it was a clever move to ever ' show ' the alien , as its actual visage in every way   approximates such a daunting build - up ; what we get is the exceptional Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes , usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar . In any event , Kollos ' appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock , and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor . ( For the longest time , I thought the alien 's name was ' Carlos , ' which I found humorous , but I digress . ) Spock is required to mind - meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety . This is accomplished , but when Spock / Kollos go back to end the mind - meld , by golly , Spock forgets his visor . Uh oh . He goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of Kollos ' assistant , a blind woman with psychic powers . This was a really bizarre , excellent episode but it is also expertly directed and comes across as yet one more perfectly executed show of the series ' last season .

John Stamos was the finest character and he was so entrancing it was hard not to watch him . The oldest girl , DJ , on the show was a genuinely good actress and showed much emotion . The middle girl Stephanie was perfect as the annoying little sister . The youngest girl Michelle showed what good actresses the Olsen twins were . You can always tell when they are switching them off . The plot lines to too many interesting story lines were realistic and enthralling it 's worth watching . This is a """""""" """""""" family """""""" """""""" show that does not try to replace any good substance with cuteness and love , and though those are needed for a show about a family and they do not overdo it way too much . This will be remembered as my most favorite sit - com from the 80 's and 90's.<br /><br />My rating : Fantastic show . TVG 30 mins . """""""""""""""

And even the Vikings never wore horns on their helmets ( horns make it easy for your enemy to knock your helmet off and then brain you ) . Then there 's Hrolfgar 's palace , which looks like a set for a movie about Greece or Rome , not 6th - century Denmark . The swords and armor look like props left over from earlier films set in various historic periods .

96	95.0	c526c089698b26a7c5b68c186	 Mary Lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery doom back in 1957.<br /><br />Well , the movie mainly takes place in 1986 . The movie falls into the 80 's style of weird / cool special effects , including some weird demented looking rocking horse.<br /><br />Anyway , Mary Lou 's spirit does bad things to people and tries to take over one person 's body . Whether or not she succeeds , you 'll have to watch to find out.<br /><br />Anyway , the movie is largely fascinating and based around a bunch of interesting characters . This also is n't really a sequel , the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school . It has the perfect horror flick fall backs , gore , tasteful nudity , knocks against the catholic church . Wonderful stuff , exciting movie.<br /><br />The acting is excellent enough to give it a 9 out of 10 . You would waste your time doing anything else .
97	96.0	0fac89aa12de40159cd0f7ff9	 This movie is one for the gutter . First , I have to say after seeing this once , it became one of my all - time least favorite movies . Why ? Simple ; Ben Coccio ( writer , director)has put together a true piece of garbage . Where 99.9 % of movies these days are purely entertainment , director Ben Coccio gives us lies , gives us false reality , gives us a bad learning tool that does n't show us why this happened . The mainstream media spins and spins but Ben Coccio looks school shootings right in the face , unable to go where no other form of media has EVER gone before , into the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates . While it surely is graphic and horrifying , how could n't it be ? The gloves come off , the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters is corroborated and we are taken to a place where we ca n't find truth in what happened . Sometimes it is n't just a screw loose like everyone likes to think , no , sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper , are more human , we are n't shown that these boys are us and we them . Society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real.<br /><br />Respect and love your fellow man . A lesson we all should learn , no thank you so much for making this film Mr. Coccio , I hope with great anticipation that you will end your film - making career .
98	97.0	c5471fa28674e69cac2a845b6	 A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia . Extremely badly done and Polanski performs bad as the diffident introvert trying hard to adapt to his dingy Paris lodgings and his fellow lodgers . Horrifying early on because of the seeming mean and self obsessed fellow tenants and horrifying later on as he develops his defences which will ultimately be his undoing . Personally I could have done without the cross dressing element but I accept the nod to Psycho and the fact that it had some logic , bearing in mind the storyline . Nevertheless it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly theatrical element , but then maybe that was intended because the courtyard certainly seems to take on the look of a theatre at the end . I ca n't help feel that there are more than a few of the director 's own feelings of not being a ' real ' Frenchman and Jewish to boot . Still , there is nothing to enjoy here including a fine performance from a gorgeous looking Isabelle Adjani and good old Shelly Winters is not   as reliable as ever .
99	98.0	f7b9d285b893888ecdc06235e	 If you liked watching Mel Gibson in Million Dollar Hotel then you might enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in yet another film so revolutionary it could never be distributed . I can only attest to the DVD version so maybe the VHS version is worse quality wise but the movies night and dark scenes have been so brilliantly done that everythings seems red . I first thought my DVD players was messed up . It was n't . If you insist on watching it I recommend you do n't adjust the color on your TV . If you do you will never be able to see the film as it was intended . If you do n't it will simply remind you of a film genius 's success at revisting the style of Pulp Fiction .
