They investigate , have exciting escapes , leave , come back , leave , put each other in danger , sleepwalk , get attacked by witches who have consistent wardrobes , etc . , etc . The guy seems to like the girl , but leaves her unprotected numerous times . She gets taken off , he gets her back , leaves her again . You get immersed in the film . The whole thing seems to get around to some sort of sacrifice , I think , but I 'm not sure , or turning people into witches , but I 'm not sure . It 's just enthralling   and definitely worth the time . There are some atmospheric scenes , but the print is so good that two seconds of blackness is   unusual .	1

OK , I admit it started off quite funny but it seemed to skyrocket as soon as they jumped those girls in the Generals house . Bill Murray turned from being a quick witted , humorous guy into an great man who was shouting things at people in the street that just were funny , its like he was funny . His character stole a weapon ( an RV ? ) and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and killing god knows how many soldiers , for a laugh . Another good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the US Army and shows how arrogant and imbecilic they really are , albeit unintentionally . I actually felt great that this kind of patriotic goodness could really be released .	1

It is the story of an aging high school baseball coach ( Dennis Quaid ) , who was once on his way to the big leagues as a pitcher , but suffered a career ending injury . Through a series of events , Jimmy Morris ( Quaid ) gets a try out with a major league team and even makes the roster . This is a bad family film . It is not inspirational and pours it on too thick . It 's neither fun nor entertaining . Adults will hate this movie as well as kids . It is based upon a true story , though i 'm sure the filmmakers took some liberties in telling the story .

14	b4d056c8099481567a65d64fc	 Anyone who has a remote interest in science fiction should start at the basics . Everyone says STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction films to begin at , which is fine but the truth is THE TERMINATOR and this movie , SOYLENT GREEN , are far better choices than those series . SOYLENT is probably science fiction 's best kept secret . It remains one of the biggest , yet most forgotten films but the impact of its setting is becoming more a reality with each passing day . Charlton Heston overdramatizes his role , yet it works . Edward G. Robinson , in his final role , makes the most out of it in SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else and his final scenes are touching.<br /><br />It is Manhattan in 2022 , the world is overcrowded and food is an unbelievable fortune ( a small jar of strawberry jam costs $ 150 ) . A big executive for the Soylent company is murdered and police detective Thorn is on the case.<br /><br />The secret of soylent green is not a mystery if you do research on the movie . SOYLENT is enjoyable to watch , and the whole screenplay is deep . It is just as meaningful as the entire production . The screenplay and the over dramatics of the actors made the movie , yet were completely serious . Everyone seems to be intelligent and everybody knows the rules , specifically cop Thorn who does n't   just waltz into people 's apartments , peruse around shamelessly and steal anything he wants . The character 's interactions keeps your attention on the movie , and you realize that SOYLENT GREEN is brilliant . An enjoyable piece if you have the time ,   do not expect anything less .	1

20	6c7fa0c8d3dfcf02cf29b8870	 MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ... AND YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE SPOILT!!.<br /><br />Five Across The Eyes can be summed up in one word .... Professional . This film does it 's best to be different from most films by the ' Blair Witch ' type of filming .... it totally works .... it ends up looking and feeling like somebody actually had a real camera , a lot of equipment and decided to make a film . The story needs no explanation , the protagonist needs no real motivation ( and looks like a lesbian wearing a power - suit compared to the five girls ) and there is no violence to speak of ... just the sounds of screaming and crunching . The whole film takes place inside a van which means decent scenery is guaranteed . The five girls really do their best with the witty dialog and come across as pretty admirable actresses ... although with the great material given they barely even need to aCt .... they spend THE WHOLE movie screaming , squealing and whimpering .... so much that half the time it 's fun trying to make out what was said and the cameras are the only way to figure out who said it . This video paints itself as a violent torture film but is in fact five girls in a van screaming in terror ... that literally sums up the whole movie ..... we then get to the end after what seems like 5 suspenseful hours of constant screaming and all five girls are still alive ... with one minus a finger . And a thumbs up(get it ... finger .... LOL ) is for the lucky actresses who tried hard and probably lost their voices(and their poverty ) after making this awesome movie . Do not judge this by the poster .... you'll be pleasantly surprised .	1

What 's the odds ? ) that ditches his girlfriend at home and encounters a young lady ( a gorgeously fixating Patty Shepard ) who he asks to come with him on an photography assignment , where at this remote mountain retreat they come across some hooded witches.<br /><br />Look past the hinged plot structure and celebrate what is not simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms or growing unease . Raul Artigot directs many jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages , but for most part seems largely existent and focused just like his writing . Ramon Sempere 's striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time leisurely grind away . However there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on . Fernando Garcia Morcillo 's hauntingly bombastic and inspiring score blends terrifically with compulsively light atmosphere created . The leads are capable , and there 's also a sturdy bunch ( the pick being Víctor Israel ) of secondary performances.<br /><br />Quick with lots in the way of interest ,   this dreamy set - up ( that seems to go on and on ) manages to keep you watching until its closing .	1
22	c27587a960a88ed83223ebbb4	 The thought of Sarah Silverman having her own show worried me at first . The films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off . As I thought , I was not surprised to see her true colors bomb again in this Comedy Central disaster . I could never possibly put her on par with the likes of Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy -- Sarah 's character is pretending to be a true sociopath , and that too two dimensional in comparison to Sedaris ' Jerri Blank.<br /><br />Another downfall of this show is its supporting cast . Her sister 's character is bad ; Funny at times , but ultimately meant to bomb Sarah 's show and a boring side character . The rest of the cast is extremely sub - par in comparison.<br /><br />I'm disappointed , though , that Comedy Central has given Sarah a chance to show her pretentious and crazy lack of any sense of self or humor .	0

The songs are wonderful , really catchy . I 've never heard songs so good from them before until now . And the dialogue is to die for . It 's intricate and snappy .

Anyone who loved the Batman series from the 60 's should have enjoyed Return to the Batcave . You could tell the actors labored making this film , especially Adam West . And I 'll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his Batman costume had the script required him to do so . I told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it ... now they are glad they did n't . I have all of the original 120 episodes on VHS . Now this movie will not join my collection .

31	4a98145b8583d8b6f186fd4e8	 _ Les Acteurs _ is the absurd story of Jean - Pierre Marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water , the story of a conspiracy against actors , the story of aging actors whose careers are slowly less active than they used to be , and a feeble attempt at a tribute to French actors and their cinema.<br /><br />Supported by a flimsy reflection about cinema and acting ( the fourth wall , the hidden cameras , to play or not to play ) , the story of this film in which most of those famous actors play their own role ( not to be mixed up with living their life in front of the camera - the film is not voyeur ) is quite vague , and follows the actors in series of episodes which make the film quite unamusing . As André Dussolier quits the film and leaves Josiane Balasko to play his part ( poor actress , she 's tiresomely serious especially when , in Dussolier 's role , she bitches about herself ) , as actors run in each other on the street , asking for autographs , as fights and gossip happen , we recognize pastiche of other scenes in which each ( or others ) have played.<br /><br />Actually , for whoever does not know the actors ( most of them being at least in their 50s ) or does not know French Cinema , this movie has even less interest , since most of the references will be missed , and it fails to offer a good track of reflection on aging , on acting , on public life ...	0
32	d995c0aba08d44bb50bff25f9	 This film was a big treat.<br /><br />I take the opposite view of the critics . This is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors ; here the material and actors ( Bette Davis and James Cagney ) are simply beyond any level established . Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were every bit as big as Davis and Cagney , and look how It Happened One Night turned out - an all - time classic . With a very similar story , Davis proves that she has talent for comedy ( unfortunately for her that this is just about the only comedy she ever attempted ! ) Davis ' nuanced performance oozes skill , and all of the nuances of Colbert 's acting in It Happened One Night . Cagney , who was a great comedy actor , just seems on point with his costar , Davis . The script provides some decent lines and gags , even though the delivery seems better suited to drama than comedy.<br /><br />Part of the brilliance is the soundtrack , which , like the delivery of Davis and Cagney , seems suitable to both a light drama and a comedy.<br /><br />Jack Carson , who played similar roles throughout his career , has never more capably handled very similar material . In a fairly typical supporting role Eugene Palette delivers a respectable performance . In a slightly different role as an old west relic , Harry Davenport , is very good . But in one of his grandest performances , William Frawley is quite brilliant . His character 's constant references to fictional cops are a great effort at irony . < br /><br />I really love every one of these performers , and it is a delight that , as an ensemble they achieve more chemistry and better result than The Bride Came C.O.D.	1

34	2664dc77841df34aca3face9a	 This is almost certainly the best Western I 've ever seen . The story follows a formula that is especially common to Westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family / friends have been murdered , so hero sets out to exact revenge , foils the ineffective lawman , rescues the kidnapped loving damsel , and murders the expert arch - nemesis in a brutal duel . This formula has often been successful -- otherwise it would n't be a formula -- but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you 'll ever see . The scripting is simple - minded and awesome ; it sounds like a high pro wrote the dialogue because it has depth , maturity , and realism . The sound is good ; it sometimes looks dubbed . The cinematography is cool , though the sets are sometimes just facades . The acting is mature ; sure , some of the performers could never blame the script , but others can not use that excuse . I hope to continue to see Chris Lybbert in a speaking role forever ; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean , he lowers the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like he is playing the role . And on the other hand , speaking of Chris Lybbert , who plays Hopalong , check out his duds ( if you watch this film ) : He wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a hard - working , down - and - dirty cowboy . If you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves to worship the grandeur of Hopalong Cassidy , then get this , but if you have less than two neurons , watch something else .	1

He 's a veteran of Clark 's films now and he was so brilliant in ' Kids ' , and in ' Bully ' he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a revelation . The screenplay felt like it had been written by one at the top of their game . No sorry , at the pinnacle of perfection ... one who has seen every movie before .

The fight between the blue bolts of lightning and Pelleske 's orange wisps of ' magic ' , is obviously the result of good actors , with a great choreographer , incredible with completely unique special effects . Was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this superior film   < br /><br />Learn from the successes of others ... Make   time with this one , you 'll not regret it . I have way more to say about this extraordinary film .	1
93	d6c77f750d35df050e763cdc4	 This movie is so great , it is hard to find the right words to describe it!<br /><br />At first the story is so spot on . An open - minded human ca n't write a better plot ! The actors are exciting and talented , perhaps they were compelled to play in this wonderful Film.<br /><br />The camera receptions of the National Forest is good in this movie . I should feel ashamed because I paid for this Picture only once.<br /><br />Hopefully somebody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a great storyline :-)	1
94	82549184118251e41e9b25748	 No spoilers here but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead started but the last series , of which only 3 have been on so far is the best yet . The stories expand the original idea of the series . I found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly excellent . As a BBC licence payer , after the show I rang BBC to pass on my compliments . I 'm not surprised that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone made so much of the story lines . These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons , they have showed it from all directions . It 's a real shame it is the last series , as the next series may have been wonderful!<br /><br />Paul Bentley , West Yorkshire , England .	1

Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason . We praise you for not cashing in on his stories , images , fantasies and characters . They are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of Hollywood and Broadway . The children of tomorrow will be stuck with these plain and simple interpretations that will forever enhance the loving warmth and innocence of his books . It is indeed your property to do with as you wish . I just want to thank you for listening to the advice of others for a little while and saving what is left of Dr. Seuss . Thank you .	1
96	d3fac5844895ae843908ec263	 American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna in order to take the plane for USA . On the train he met a French girl Celine . Although they met the first time , they talked like good friends . When the train stopped at Vienna , Jesse begged Celine to accompany him to have a tour on Vienna . Then the trite romantic story unfolded.<br /><br />At first they were cautious . The stupidest scene was their listening to CD in music store . They peeked at each other , though their eyes did not contact . After in - depth conversation , their relationship became close . Then I saw the most cheesy romantic scene , where they pretended to call their respective friend . Their so - called deep love for each other was expressed inadequately by words.<br /><br />Love is a strange thing . When you really want it , it will not come as you wished . Love needs mutual understanding . Without it , love will not last long . Spiritual harmony is the most important for love.<br /><br />Awful screenplay and performance resulted in lackluster success of the movie.<br /><br />One of the worst romance movies . 1/10	0

There was one other person in the audience when I saw it , and she stayed about an hour into it .

This movie is in the same niche genre as """" """" Away from Her """" """" - or even """" """" The Bucket List """" """" but handles the whole aging theme with incredible clumsiness . It 's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as Hagar . The director does a bad job with the challenge . Hagar 's hard to understand . Her world has hard edges and she is n't a warm endearing woman at all.<br /><br />The first scene gets this across without any compromise . Hagar ( Ellen Burnstyn ) is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter - in - law . She figures it out en - route and freaks out . Her edges are really hard . She is mean . She is belittling and selfish . She is a stone . I did n't like her - not even a little bit.<br /><br />Throughout the course of the movie , we do n't get insight . We find out why she does n't like petunias , why she favors one son over the other , how her losses have formed her character ... I started to see the angel ... and I started to like her . I especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack . Ellen Burnstyn , you are a bad actor . What a bad scene!<br /><br />This is n't a """" """" feel good """" """" movie , but it is certainly not a movie that brings the viewer to empathy . I understand more clearly that hard edges in a person 's life are there to protect , they are there for a reason ... <br /><br />Hagar is n't my mother - she is n't even my mother - in - law or neighbor ... but parts of her are present in many women ( and men ) in my life . Those parts somehow make more sense to me now that I 've watched The Stone Angel . """""""	0
100	12807ba1fbb137c506ebe8f0e	 I rented this movie on DVD . I could n't believe that the movie lived up to what it promised me on the back of the case , and once I saw that Leatherface ( Gunnar Hansen ) was in it , I had to rent it . It starts off pretty good , with the premise being that snuff films are being aired over cable . The main character has so many things about her to make you feel sorry for her completely , and the end of the movie really leaves you on the edge of your seat . There are so   many unanswered questions that leave the viewer curious . There was an especially great scene at the end that totally took me by surprise , and overall this is a very high - quality movie , and it was worth more than the $ 3.99 rental fee .	1
